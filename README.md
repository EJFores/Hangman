# Hangman
Just another Hangman game.

This program was originally written by me as a demo game when I was first learning Java. I have uploaded the code to github to serve as a project that I can update and tinker with in languages other than just Java. 


### Version notes

##### Java Edition
As mentioned before this was originally written when i was first learning programming. As such the GUI is not the cleanest to look at.

##### Python Edition
Using the external RandomWords library, the game in this version is now way harder using obscure words, no longer bound by a text file.
